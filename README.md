Machine Learning projects
This Github rep is meant to keep tracks of my personal projects in machine learning. I used to want to have one or 2 big projects, but now, I'd rather work on small projects and a lot of them, rather than start a big project and give up after some time as I can't work 8 hours a day on it, so I forget stuff when I get back to them and I lose a lot of time. The goal here is to work on one mini project a day, commit and push it here, to have a nice collection of the work I do. 
As of today (27/04/2025), this repo will msotly be used for the 30 day Computer Vision challenge I found on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiTw5KFw7ic&t=4s
These videos are made by Felipe, and are super useful to understand the concepts of CV, which is a field that really interests me. I'll do my best to work every day on this challenge, and not to skip any day.

Here is a recap of all the projects that will be in this repo : 

01_mlp_no_lib : building a basic MLP for the California Housing dataset with no libraries (no tensorflow, pytorch, just pandas and numpy)
Great project to understand the maths behind the gradient descent. 
TODO : add my manual notes and calculation of the gradient descent, and if I have the time, I'll write an article about the tutorial to be able to reproduce the project

Series of Dayxx_cv : 
As mentionned, this is the 30 day CV challenge on Yotube. The goal will be to do one project a day, so I'd expect to complete the challenge by the end of May if all goes well

day1_cv : first day of the challenge, with a pretty complete OpenCV tutorial
day2_cv : building a color detector to detect yellow !
day3_cv : building a face anonymizer
